# spikesort-hp
My wrapper code for spike sorting with kilosort

You should clone this and the github repository:

- kilosort2.0


and place them in a flat directory structure, e.g.:

 ~\spikesort

    |--spikesort-hp
    
    |--kilosort2.0
    

Then navigate to the spikesort-hp\scripts folder and: 
- runBatchKilosort.m to run kilo2.0 on a bunch of files in matlab using SC's custom settings

Recommend to first run the built-in kilosort gui (kilosort.m in in the kilosort2.0 repo) to check kilosort installation

Then can run batch KS using our custom settings
